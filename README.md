# Reap-What-You-Sow
Reap What You Sow is a Team Project for my Game Design Capstone class

In the project I will do a chunk of the programming, as well as some story writing.

Reap What You Sow is a top down 2D Horror/Farming Sim inspired by games like Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, and Stardew Valley.
